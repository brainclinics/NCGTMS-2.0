# NCGTMS-2.0

NCG-TMS

One specific example where we pioneered a more individualized approach to rTMS in the treatment of depression is through Neuro-Cardiac-Guided TMS, or NCG-TMS.

The NCG-TMS app for iOS

The Brainclinics Foundation developed Heart-Brain Connect, a breakthrough NCG-TMS app to assist clinicians in pinpointing the optimal location for rTMS treatment. Our unique approach has great advantages over more traditional methods and can be tried for free. The app can also be used as a resonant breathing training method.

Heart-Brain Connect is available in the iOS App store.
